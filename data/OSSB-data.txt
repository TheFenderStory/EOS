- Movepool: Ice Punch, Seed Bomb, Recover
- Notes: Well it seems like a thick beard really is the best defense and offense!  Good set up sweeper as well as an effective revenge killer. Very good at cleaning late game when bulkier walls that checking are gone.

~Master Float - Floatzel - Focus Sash
- Ability: Magic Immunity - Immune to all status and indirect damage, +2.5 Attack on entry
- Move: Float's Sharingans - Protect + copies all positive stat boosts and volatiles (substitute, leech seed, aqua ring, etc). PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 3

- Move: Furry Cosplay, switches forms between Pikachu and Fennekin and will replace moves accordingly.  Boosts speed and special attack by 1 stage, but will not boost them higher than +1.  Has a 15% chance of failing and KO'ing itself.  Changes weather accordingly for the form.
- Movepool: Thunder/Searing Shot, Steam Eruption/SolarBeam, Hurricane/Earth Power
- Notes: Priority, Neo Soul, CGTNathan and Erica hurts it a lot.  Watch out for it's ability to form change and turn a losing type matchup into a favourable matchup.

&Erica07 - Meloetta - Leftovers
- Ability: Mischievous - Prankster + Ignores substitutes and type effectiveness.
- Move: Admonish - Uses haze, worry seed, and noble roar on the opponent. PP: 5 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 1
- Movepool: Rest, Sleep Talk, Shadow Ball
- Notes: Remove boosts from the opponent in hopes of saving your team from getting swept. If the opponent doesn't have a reliable way to deal a lot of damage to it, it can really turn games around. 

&Mighty Sciz - Charizard-Mega-X - Charizardite-X
- Ability: Dragon's Fire - Multiscale + Tough Claws + Moxie
- Move: Dragon Strike - Physical, 120BP, 1/3 recoil, Dragon Type, 50% of getting a defense boost. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 1
- Movepool: Dragon Dance, Belly Drum, Fire Punch, Flare Blitz, Shadow Claw, Double-Edge, Roost
- Notes: A frightening revenge killer that is capable of sweeping as well, be afraid if you see the Dragon dance + Roost set. The recoil can prevent it from sweeping as effectively, but still very dangerous.

&Sky Might Fall - Gyarados-Mega - Gyaradosite
- Ability: Cursed Aura - Opponent takes 15% on entry and exit of this Pokémon
- Move: Silent Departure - 100 BP Dark type U-turn. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Sucker Punch, Night Slash, Crabhammer, Pursuit, Focus Energy, Dragon Dance

- Movepool: Ice Punch, Bullet Punch, Swords Dance, Stealth Rock
- Notes: Have fun hitting hard! Extremely strong STAB, setup options and very little ways to stop it.

@Nii Sama - Darkrai - Life Orb

- Ability: Bro Power - Volt Absorb + Regenerator + Magic Guard
- Move: Omega Blast - Special, 130BP Water type move that raises defense by 2 stages, and has a 80% chance to burn the opponent. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Roar, Sticky Web, Slack Off
- Notes: Very good physical wall that can stop the very common Physical sweepers in the metagame in its tracks, with a very high chance to burn, immunity to Status, Electric moves and residual damage, and ways to boost its defense even higher. Regenerator helps in keeping it healthy, making it one of the best walls in the metagame.

@Safety Shark - Garchomp-mega - Garchompite
- Ability: Magic Guard
- Move: DragonBot-Z - 80 BP Physical Dragon type attack, heals status, ignores opponent’s defensive boosts, and boosts attack and speed by 1 stage. PP: 15 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Knock Off, Earthquake, Recover
- Notes: Good physical set up sweeper that takes everything down. Once it gets a couple boosts, it's hard to come back.

%Alliance NTG - Dragonite - Weakness Policy
- Ability: Simple
- Move: Dragon Energy - 60 BP Dragon Type Physical move. Raises Attack and Speed by 2 Stages. PP: 20 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 1
- Movepool: ExtremeSpeed, Dragon Claw, Earthquake
- Notes: Good and fast Setup Sweeper, with a weak yet very dangerous boosting move, and Extreme Speed for revenge killing. Can be hard to start the sweep, with so many extremly powerful attackers taking it down easily, but once it's boosted, it can be a huge threat to unprepared teams.

%Chief Sokka - Gliscor - Toxic Orb
- Ability: Cancerous Ability - Poison Heal, +1 special defense on entry.
- Move: Super Bat - Brave Bird (25% recoil)
- Movepool: Knock Off, Swords Dance, Earthquake, Roost
- Notes: Physically Bulky as an Gliscor, with a neat boost to Special Defense. Can also boost and sweep lategame, against slower threats, and has the neat Flying STAB that Gliscor usually lack.

%CreaturePhil - Rotom-W - Sitrus Berry
- Ability: feelsgd - Levitate + Soundproof + Harvest
- Move: Water Bomb - 120BP, special water type move, 1000% burn chance, now who said scald was bad! PP: 5 / Accuracy: 90% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Volt Switch, Will-o-wisp, Pain Split
- Notes: Good check to some of the metagame's scary physical attackers and water types, and the burn chance is quite amazing together with the accuracy. Harvest Sitrus Berry keeps it alive for more time than you'll want it to. 

%Emg E4 Volco - Volcanion - Balloon
- Ability: Adaptabulksturdy (Adaptability + fur coat + sturdy)
- Move: Volcanion Super Smash - 150BP special, fire type move, 80% to boost user's speed by 2 stages. PP: 5 / Accuracy: 80% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Psystrike, Thunder, Searing Shot, Steam Eruption
- Notes: Taking a hit from this is not fun, it's power is surprisingly high and can threaten frail sweepers by forcing them to attack or switch instead of boosting. Sturdy and Fur Coat are neat because it can let it get a KO on dangerous threats the rest of your team wouldn't be able to stop by living its hits and dishing out massive damage. However, it misses its attacks quite oftem, which can really be annoying.

%hayleysworld - Vaporeon (Water/Fairy type) - Leftovers
- Ability: Aquatic Dreams - Gets a boost of 1 stage to SpD and Def upon entry; Regenerator upon switch
- Move: Revenge of Neptune - 90BP Special Water move, 100% to raise defense, special attack, and special defense by 1 stage, puts up a wish, 30% chance to burn.  PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Protect, Moonblast, Ice Beam
- Notes: It's pretty broken if you don't have a way to stop it, and will either sweep or wall your team if used correctly, though it has checks and counters so it's not completely unstoppable.

%Irraquated - Ho-oh - Life Orb
- Ability: What's the time? - Desolate Land + Magic Guard + Regenerator
- Move: Time 2 Die - 120 BP Fire type move, 60% chance to burn. Thaws user. PP: 20 / Accuracy: 90% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Recover, Brave Bird, Wood Hammer
- Notes: If you think it's not time to die, then you're wrong. There are little things that can take hits from this, with its Sun Boosted STAB Move tearing holes through teams. Ho-Oh's usually crippling weakness to Rocks and Water Moves is fixed by its Ability, making it even harder to combat. However, it's quite slow compared to most of the dangerous sweepers running wild in OSSB, and doesn't have a lot of Physical bulk, so it can be quite easily taken down by strong physical sweepers. However, it is still a very dangerous threat you don't want to face.

%iSandman - Landorus-Incarnate - Life Orb
- Ability: God's Force - Sheer Force
- Move: Mega Earth Fissure - 110 BP special, ground type attack, with secondary effects, hits non grounded pokemon for 1.5x damage. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0

- Ability: fuckyouup - Tough Claws, recoil reduced by 80%, Speed Boost
- Move: Flying Forretress - Sky Drop with 130 BP, 60% to boost defense and special defense by 1 stage. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Earthquake, Brave Bird, Head Smash, Earthquake, Iron Head, Roost
- Notes: Don't bother trying to find something to switch into this, because you won't.  It leaves no survivors in it's path with it's extremely powerful attacks, and is one of the best wallbreakers in this meta. Once your checks are gone, it will tear so many holes in your team.

%Phoenix Gryphon - Staravia - Eviolite
- Ability: Feather Coat - Magic Guard + Fur Coat
- Move: Nidificate - Uses protect and boosts attack, defense, special defense, and speed by 3 stages, works first turn only. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 4
- Movepool: Toxic, Brave Bird, Roost
- Notes: Extremely hard to take down with physical attackers, use this to your advantage and sweep with a recoilless Brave Bird! However, don't forget to use Nidificate, or it will be very weak.

%Selena - Vivillon (Bug/Fairy type) - Leftovers
- Ability: Headstrong - Magic Guard + Reckless + 1.3x modifier on all special moves, defense and special defense are boosted by 2 stages on entry.
- Move: Bitchslap - Dual type Fighting/Rock Special attack, 80 BP, hits the opponent's Defence, 30% chance of paralyzing. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Light of Ruin, Quiver Dance, Bug Buzz, Air Slash, Heat Wave, Recover, Heal Bell
- Notes: Amazing boosting sweeper with quite some bulk behind it, due to the boosts. It's typing lets it stop a lot of the strong priority users in the Metagame, and Magic Guard means it doesn't just get destroyed by hazards. With one Quiver Dance, a move from this thing will be very hard to switch into.

%Starfox :3 - Victini (Bug/Psychic type) - Leftovers
- Ability: Shit User - Defiant + lowers opponent's defense by 1 stage + Raises Speed by 2.
- Move: REKTMIND - Physical Psychic attack, 130BP, lowers opponent's Special defense by 1 stage. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Recover, V-Create, Megahorn
- Notes: A great revenge killer and wallbreaker, with good coverage. Strong priority can stop it, however it is still quite hard to deal with.

+casty - Castform - Focus Sash
- Ability: Forecast 2 - +1 defense and special defense on entry, summons Hail, Intense Sun, Sandstorm or Heavy Rain and boosts defense and special defense by 1 stage, then changes its for depending on what weather was summoned.
- Move: Adaptation - Uses protect and adds ability based on the current weather, Sun: Chlorophyll, Rain: Swift Swim, Hail: Ice Body, Sand: Sand Rush PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 4
- Movepool: Weather Ball, Earth Power, [Hurricane, Thunder, Energy Ball, Solar Beam - depending on weather]
- Notes: One of the few pokemon that can summon weather, but can be unpredictable at times, if lucky you can do some major damage with it.

+Chronologically - Victini (Fire/Fighting type) - Balloon
- Ability: Victory Prankster - Their non-damaging moves have their priority increased by 1
- Move: Power Up Meme - 70BP Physical Fighting move, 100% to raise the attack by 1 stage. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0 (Boosted by ability)

- Ability: Speedy Gonzales - Protean + Speed Boost
- Move: Hydro Smash - 120 BP Special Water Move, 10% to Paralyze or Flinch, raises defense and special defense by 1 stage, lowers speed by 1 stage. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 90% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Ice Beam, Extrasensory, Dark Pulse
- Notes: Despite having no reliable recovery, if this pokemon gets too many boosts, few Pokmeon can stop it, from hitting hard and fast. Great, full STAB coverage makes it hard to take hits from this Pokemon.

+Otami - Vileplume - Black Sludge
- Ability: s-s-senpai - Raises SpDef and Def by 1 stage, lowers opponent's SpDef by 2 Stages, and causes Infatuation on entry.
- Move: what do you mean - 110 BP Special Grass Move. 30% chance to confuse the target. PP: 20 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Spore, Nasty Plot, Sludge Bomb, Psychic 
- Notes: It's a fantastic wallbreaker, with a STAB 110 BP Move, and against lowered Special Defense, it can obliterate opponents if they're not ready. It can also take some hits, giving it more durability and more potential to kill. It has a setup option in Nasty Plot, and Spore as well put threats to sleep, and infatuation with chance to confuse can really be game changing. It's an answer to many of the bulky Water types in the tier, and if used right, can be a cute destructiveflower.

+Piscean - Miltank (Normal/Ghost type) - Leftovers
- Ability: No, you! - If it gets hits by a move, the user receives 33% recoil, if hit by a crit it returns 100% recoil, uses reflect and light screen on entry
- Move: Fatniss Evereat - Magic coat for the turn, uses toxic, cures status, boosts defense and special defense by 1 stage. PP: 15 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 4
- Movepool: Roar, Stealth Rock, Milk Drink
- Notes: A good counter to set up pokemon by punishing pokemon when they hit it. Can be stopped by Taunt, and by the many Pokemon imune to Toxic and residual damage, but it always very annoying to kill and deal with, and can support its team quite a lot.

+Sota Higurashi - Victini - Expert Belt
- Ability: Contrary
- Move: Zen Create - Psychic type V-Create. PP: 5 / Accuracy: 95% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: U-turn, V-Create, Bolt Strike
- Notes: Hits very hard, and prepare to be walled if you do not deal with this quickly enough. Severely weak to hazards and residual damage, with no way to recover anything.

Gnarly Commie - Munchlax - Eviolite
- Ability: Communism - Increases defense, special defense, and speed by 2 stages when it KO's an opposing Pokemon.
- Move: /ebat - Heals to full hp, 102 BP Physical Normal Type attack, and bypasses protect. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 2
- Movepool: Belly Drum, Pursuit, Drain Punch
- Notes: The bulk is real.  If you give Munchlax a free chance to use belly drum, say goodbye to your team...Belly.

Imp Fallen Blood - Sceptile-Mega (Grass/Flying) - Sceptilite
- Ability: Pirate - Trace + Gastro Acid
- Move: Jet Gattling - 120 BP special Grass type move, 60% of lowering special defense by 2 stages. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Aeroblast, Aura Sphere, Earth Power
- Notes: A unique pokemon in this format, acting as a check to many water types, and a good wallbreaker if used right. Can really take advantage of a lot of pokemon in the tier by taking their abilities away, and using it itself. 

Mr. CGTNathan - Cofagrigus - Leftovers
- Ability: Graveyard - Trick room is active when this Pokémon is on the field, completely reverses priority.
- Move: Graveyard Strike - 80BP Hex that will burn the opponent before the damage is dealth. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Recover, Destiny Bond, Heal Bell
- Notes: This Pokémon affect the metagame a lot by turning many physical attacker's speed and attack back on them with a "super fast" Graveyard Strike.  I hope you have a burn heal ready...

Nineage - Arceus - Life Orb
- Ability: error - Uses Defog on Entry
- Move: Break Code - Randomly scatters entry hazards on both sides, sets random weather, sets random status on itself, and then faints. PP: 5 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 8
- Movepool: Extreme Speed, Metronome, Present
- Notes: Hazards, especially Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, are a thorn in the side for most fire types and set up sweepers.  While it does cause the user trouble, the opponent is also put under pressure.  Use this move with caution, when only a major part of your team is unaffected by the hazards, or when you truly need their support to counter the opponent's sweepers. STAB Life Orb Extreme Speed can be used to revenge kill threats at low health.

Omega Nivans - Octillery - Expert Belt
- Ability: Machinegunner - Technician + Skill Link, all single hit moves hit 5 times, +2 defense and special defense on entry
- Move: Anti-Material Rifle - Special, Attacks 6 times in a row, 30 BP, each attack of a different random type. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Water Shuriken, Ominous Wind, Charge Beam, Flame Charge, Power-up Punch, Nuzzle, Frost Breath, Air Cutter, Bulldoze, DragonBreath, Heart Stamp, Echoed Voice, Metal Claw, Revenge, Mega Drain, Fury Cutter, Poison Tail, Draining Kiss, Parabolic Charge, Ice Shard, Shadow Sneak, Storm Throw
- Notes: Try your luck with Nivans; he's full of surprises that can make the opponent suffer! Due to its huge movepool full of Set Up moves, and a 5 Hit, very powerful Priority move, it's incredibly hard to wall and deal with.

Origin Server - Mew - Leftovers
- Ability: Uses TopsyTurvy against opponent on entry
- Move: Tri Spikes - Puts up 3 layers of spikes. PP: 20 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Transform, Psystrike, Recover
- Notes: Supports teams well with Hazards, and is really a blessing to have against the plethora of sweepers in the tier. 

Omega Chime - Chimecho - Life Orb
- Ability: Wave Guard - Magic Guard + Unaware. Raises Speed, Defense, Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage upon entry.
- Move: Audioshock - 80 BP Fairy Type Move. Sound Move. 60% chance to raise Special Attack by one Stage. PP: 15 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Recover, Psystrike, Earthpower
- Notes: Good revenge killer, and very good setup sweeper, with a dangerous offensive typing, good movepool that hit almost every type combination and two very helpful abilities, making it a very difficult threat to switch into. The high chance to raise Special Attack can prove deadly if you have no checks. However, it's quite frail even with defense boosts, and the speed isn't the best compared to some of the strongest sweepers in the tier. It will tear down your team while being cuter than you!
