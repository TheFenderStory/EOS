Players get <b>1</b> Guess per clue/clue-set.<br><br><b>• Trivia:</b> The host will either provide a list of questions or use Safety Shark to host an automated game of Trivia, usually the first player to 10 points is the winner!<br><br><b>• Family Feud:</b> W.I.P. group trivia game that is currently being fleshed out and having rules applied to it by <i>Audino Primal</i> and will probably have a proper desc. Later on~!<br><br><b>• Town of Salem:</b> Town of Salem can be seen as an automated version of Mafia, where the townsfolk have to lynch all criminals and evildoers before they themselves are all killed off by them, it's a somewhat complex game for newer players, but features a lot of easy game modes to get them started!!<br><br><b>• Portmanteau:</b> The host will assign 2 generations + types <i>i.e [gen 1 Poison] & [gen 1 Poison]</i> from which the players have to make a <i>portmanteau</i> that is connected by at least two letters.
